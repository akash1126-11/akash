ðŸ“Š Stock Market Prediction Project

The stock market is highly volatile and influenced by multiple factors such as the global economy, company performance, market sentiment, and investor psychology. This project aimed to design a predictive model that leverages historical stock market data to forecast future price movements and long-term trends. Using five years of past stock prices (2013â€“2018) as training data, the model successfully predicts stock behavior from 2019â€“2030, providing a long-term perspective on performance with an accuracy of 78%.

Objectives

The key objectives were to:

Analyze historical data for market patterns and trends.

Apply machine learning and deep learning models for prediction.

Evaluate accuracy and reliability across algorithms.

Support investors in decision-making by forecasting upward or downward stock movement.

Methodology

The project began with data collection and preprocessing, including cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, normalizing features, and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA). Feature engineering was applied by creating moving averages, exponential moving averages, RSI, and other technical indicators, alongside time-series lag features.

For model building, both traditional machine learning models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, SVM) and advanced deep learning models (LSTM) were implemented. The performance of each approach was compared using metrics like accuracy, RMSE, and RÂ² score. The LSTM-based deep learning model outperformed others, achieving 78% prediction accuracy.

Tools & Technologies

The project was developed using Python with libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, and TensorFlow/Keras. Jupyter Notebook was used for interactive analysis, and GitHub for version control and collaboration.

Results & Outcomes

The project successfully built a stock prediction system with 78% accuracy. It provided reliable long-term projections for 2019â€“2030, helping identify patterns in stock behavior and enabling valuable insights for investors.

Impact & Learning

This project enhanced understanding of financial time-series forecasting, data preprocessing, and feature engineering. It strengthened skills in applying machine learning and deep learning techniques to real-world financial data, contributing to improved decision-making in stock market investments
